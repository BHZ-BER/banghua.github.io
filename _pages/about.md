I'm an incoming assistant professor at UW ECE, with adjunct appointments in CSE.  I received my PhD from the Department of EECS, UC Berkeley. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jiantao Jiao and Prof. Michael I. Jordan. I'm a recipient of the 2023 David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize from Berkeley EECS for truly outstanding PhD research.

I co-founded Nexusflow AI since 2023. We are dedicated to provide reliable LLM solutions for enterprise use-cases. 

I'm currently interested in the training, serving, evaluation, and applications of foundation models. I have also been working on statistics, information theory and machine learning, with applications on game theory, robust statistics, reinforcement learning and human-AI interactions.
